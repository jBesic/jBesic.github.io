<p class="message">
  Hey there! My name is Jasmin Besic and I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</p>

<p>With over 7 years of experience as a full stack engineer, I have a strong foundation in a variety of technologies, including Angular, PHP, Java, Spring Boot, .NET, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL. I have also had the opportunity to lead teams on multiple projects, collaborating with line managers, product owners, and QA engineers to ensure smooth and successful project execution. My communication and organizational skills are key assets in my ability to thrive in fast-paced, dynamic work environments.</p>

<p>This website is my platform to share the knowledge and experience I have gained throughout my career, as well as to continue learning through the act of writing about various subjects. I believe that the process of writing about a topic is a powerful way to deepen one's understanding and appreciation of it.</p>
