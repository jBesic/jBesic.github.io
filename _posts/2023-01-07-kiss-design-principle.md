  What is Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)?
</div>

In software engineering, KISS stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid." This acronym is often used as a design principle to guide the development of software systems. It suggests that systems should be designed to be as simple as possible, and that complexity should be avoided whenever possible. The idea behind KISS is that simpler systems are generally easier to understand, maintain, and modify, and are therefore less prone to errors and more likely to be successful.

Here are a few ways to follow the KISS principle in software engineering:

* Minimize the number of features: Only include the features that are absolutely necessary, and avoid adding unnecessary complexity to the system.
* Use simple and intuitive designs: Design the system in a way that is easy for users to understand and navigate.
* Keep the code clean and well-organized: Use clear and concise naming conventions, and make sure the code is well-documented and easy to read.
* Use simple and reliable technologies: Choose technologies that are well-established and have a proven track record of stability and reliability.
* Avoid over-engineering: Don't try to solve problems that don't exist, and be mindful of the trade-offs between complexity and simplicity.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your software system is as simple and straightforward as possible, which can make it easier to understand, maintain, and modify over time.

## What does "over-engineered" mean

Over-engineering refers to the practice of adding unnecessary complexity to a system. This can happen when a designer or developer tries to solve problems that don't exist, or when they try to anticipate every possible future use case and build in features to address them.

Over-engineering can be a problem because it can make a system more difficult to understand, maintain, and modify. It can also make the system more expensive to develop and deploy, and can increase the risk of errors and bugs.

To avoid over-engineering, it's important to focus on the core requirements of the system and to resist the temptation to add unnecessary features or complexity. It's also helpful to regularly review the design and architecture of the system to identify and remove any unnecessary complexity.
