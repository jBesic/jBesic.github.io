# How to Override Page Files with Chrome DevTools

Chrome DevTools is an essential tool for web developers, allowing them to inspect and debug web pages in real-time. In addition to these core features, Chrome DevTools also includes the ability to override page files, which can be a valuable tool for testing changes to a website without affecting the live version.

In this beginner's guide, we'll walk through the steps to use Chrome DevTools to override page files, allowing you to improve your web development workflow and test changes with ease.

## Step 1: Open Chrome DevTools

To get started, open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking on any element of a webpage and selecting `Inspect` from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows or `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac.

## Step 2: Go to the Sources Panel

Once you have opened Chrome DevTools, navigate to the `Sources` panel. This panel allows you to view and edit the files that make up the webpage you're currently viewing.

## Step 3: Select the Overrides Tab

In the `Sources` panel, click on the `Overrides` tab. This tab allows you to override the resources that the webpage loads, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Step 4: Select a Folder for Overrides

Before you can start overriding page files, you need to select a local directory to save the overridden files. Click the `Select folder for overrides` button and choose a folder on your computer where you want to save the overridden files.

## Step 5: Save a File for Overrides

Go to the page you want to override and open the file you want to modify in the `Sources` panel. Right-click on the file and select `Save for overrides`. This will save a local copy of the file that you can modify without affecting the live version of the webpage.

## Step 6: Make Your Changes

Open the local copy of the file you just saved and make the changes you want to test. You can modify the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript as needed. When you're done making changes, save the file.

## Step 7: Refresh the Page

Refresh the page you're testing to see your changes take effect. If you don't see the changes, make sure that you've saved the local copy of the file and that the Overrides feature is enabled.

## Conclusion

Using Chrome DevTools to override page files is a valuable tool for web developers, allowing them to test changes to a website without affecting the live version. By following the steps outlined in this beginner's guide, you can improve your web development workflow and make testing changes easier than ever before.
